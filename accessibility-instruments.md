            <p>According to the authors, the main motivation to develop an accessibility instrument can be roughly divided in
              three categories: policy and planning support, scientific enquiry, or a combination of the two. 10 can be placed in the first category, 4 in the second, and 8 in the third.</p>

              remaining 4 are focused on managing, encouraging or reducing the use of a particular transport mode – transport
              planning oriented.</p>
