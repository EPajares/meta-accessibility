 The model consists of two major modules: (1) an initialisation module and (2) a simulation module. The initialisation module includes all functions that read all the input data for the model. The input data includes information concerning households, retail services and transportation system. The actual processing of the data then happens in the simulation module which runs the given number of simulation cycles. The idea is to model the cumulative effects of accessibility and the interaction of urban actors within the physical framework created by the urban structures. The focus of the modelling tool is to observe how different accessibility factors influence on a spatial organization of retail units and how this process can be simulated by using agent based modelling methodologies.
