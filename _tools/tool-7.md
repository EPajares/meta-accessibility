Place Syntax Tool (PST) is an application for the desktop software MapInfo. Place syntax introduces the possibility to  conduct descriptions and analyses of accessibility from a life-world point of view in just as systematic and quantitative a way. The ‘place syntax’ approach has great potential for the development of new tools for urban planning and design, not only for predicting pedestrian flow or estimating urban accessibilities, not least to redefine the concepts of densities and areas. The aim of the research is to help urban studies and practice to find new and possibly more informative ways or presenting place data in general.
