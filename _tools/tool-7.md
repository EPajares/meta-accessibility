GOAT stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-instrument is meant to be open source, interactive, flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is developed by Plan4Better GmbH. GOAT is designed to model active mobility (e.g. walking, cycling), enhancements and extensions (e.g. public transport) are done on a regular basis. Plan4Better provides the tool as software-as-a-service worldwide and you can test the demo version for the City of Munich.
