The instruments presented here are: Spatial Integration Accessibility (SIA) and Angular Segment Analysis by Metric Distance (ASAMD) and they both belong to the wider theoretical and methodological field of space syntax developed in the Space Lab of University College London. Both instruments are measuring spatial accessibility. SIA is using a spatial representation called axial line and on the topological distance between axial lines based on the number of steps from one line to the other while ASAMD includes in the axial analysis furthermore the angles of incidence between lines, the segmentation by junction of the axial line and the effect that metric radii would have on the choice of routes and the trips destinations.
