The proposed instrument defines the accessibility to technical infrastructure at the strategic level of spatial planning. Accessibility to technical infrastructure is in the first stage defined in terms of the physical accessibility to the technical infrastructure. Physical accessibility to technical infrastructure is measured as the accessibility to the provided land use at the local level, taking into account the capacity of the existing and planned technical infrastructure and the physical distance from the technical infrastructure. However, the final goal of the instrument is to define the cost accessibility to the technical infrastructure as well.
