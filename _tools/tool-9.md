The PAC is a psychometric scale which evaluates the individualsÂ´own perceptions of accessibility either for daily travel in general, or by a specific transport mode or combinations of modes. The PAC was developed by researchers at Karlstad University, Sweden, as a complement to objectively based accessibility tools and focus lies on capturing the individual dimension of accessibility. The PAC has been used in practice in a number of countries and may be helpful in identifying segments of individuals (or areas) with low accessibility, or to evaluate effects of different interventions from the perspective of the travelers. It comes in three versions, each consisting of 4 items (scale 1-7) which may be assessed separately or together as an index for an overall perceived accessibility score.
