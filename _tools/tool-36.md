What opportunities for social cohesion do cities provide? Is your neighbourhood park frequented by a homogenous or diverse mix of people? How many amenities can you reach within a short walking distance? And do you often encounter people from different walks of life? The interactive CTwalk web tool maps opportunities that different age groups can reach in a 5 or 15-minute walk. It uses granular population, location, and pedestrian network data from open sources to estimate how many children, adults, and elderly citizens can reach various destinations in a city within a short walk. By emphasizing the degree of pedestrian co-accessibility of various city destinations, CTwalk Map seeks to highlight the social cohesion potential of neighbourhoods while also unmasking local access inequities.
