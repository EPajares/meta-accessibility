This instrument has been developed by the planning authorities in Oslo, in order to help dimension shopping centres in the municipality in accordance with their overall plan for development of shopping and services (Municipality of Oslo, 2003). The planning authorities apply the method, together with the plan itself, to calculate the maximum size for new shopping centres or extensions of shopping centres in specific locations, in order for the centre to serve a population about equal to the number living in walking- and bicycling distance from the centre. The instrument and the plan are interrelated.
