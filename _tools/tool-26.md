The European Rail Accessibility Model developed at the Chair of Urban Development, Technical University of Munich tracks and projects changes of accessibility induced by the development of high-speed rail since 1990 and until 2030. It monitors gravitational accessibility of population as well as a number of graph theory-based connectivity measures (such as degree and betweenness centrality) on a regional scale.
