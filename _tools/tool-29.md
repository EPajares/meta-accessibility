StationsRadar is an open web-based planning support tool intended to support integrated land use and transport strategy-making, with a geographical focus on railway stations and their areas in the regions of Flanders and Brussels. The main feature of the tool is that it allows to visualize accessibility profiles for selections of stations that are made by the user. Besides these profiles, additional graphs, maps and information can be consulted. The tool was validated in the Flemish planning practice and aims to support policy and planning discussions dealing with the development potential of railway stations and their areas in Flanders and Brussels.
