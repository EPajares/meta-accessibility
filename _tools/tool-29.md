One of the main motivations of the IMaFa accessibility instrument is to assess the level of service of public transport when accessing shopping centres in the MetroSur influence area. However isochrone maps can be applied to other type of facilities (health care, education, etc.). The instrument of isochrone maps defines accessibility as the opportunities for ease of access and takes as a case study the access to shopping centres by public transit. The accessibility instrument is measured as the process associated with getting to and from the shopping centres by public transit. The main strengths of the present accessibility instrument are its low data requirements, and the ease of calculation, transmission and interpretation of results.
