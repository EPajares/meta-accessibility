SNAMUTS is a GIS-based tool to assess the relationship between public transport network configuration, performance and service standards on the one hand, and the geographical distribution or clustering of land use activities across a metropolitan area on the other hand. The instrument breaks down the land use-transport system into a set of activity nodes and route segments derived from the hierarchy of activity centres identified in strategic planning documents, and the location and service standard of public transport routes.
