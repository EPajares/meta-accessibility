The TUM Accessibility Atlas is a multi-modal GIS-based instrument specifically developed for decision-making in the Munich Metropolitan Region. Hence, thematic datasets and measures (e.g. monetary costs, carbon emissions) were added to ensuring the ability to tackle the latest planning issues. The accessibility analysis ranges from regional (e.g. car and public transport) to local neighborhood scale taking into account active mobility (walking and cycling). The aim is to create a suitable instrument which can be used by a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. practitioners, decision-makers, citizens) raising awareness of the implications of their actions (e.g. land-use and transport interventions or individual mobility behavior).
