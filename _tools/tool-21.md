TRACE - Retail Cluster Accessibility was designed to analyse the retail landscape of Flanders and as a possible aid for developing a new restrictive retail policy based on spatial planning. The tool tests to what extent the parameters of the classic spatial interaction models are still valuable. TRACE is able to show which areas are interesting for retailers to invest in, areas where they can fulfil their economic needs, by linking clusters to socioeconomic location factors. The tool has been developed using Model Builder in the ArcGIS 10 suit, developed and distributed by ESRI.
