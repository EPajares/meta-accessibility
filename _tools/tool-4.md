The basic concepts in ACCALC are that it is a relational database helping planners to manage large and complex data sets and to output meaningful accessibility indicators (DfT 2011). Version 1 allowed users to upload spatially referenced data on land uses, spatially referenced data on locations from which trips are generated and tables showing the deterrents affecting travel between each origin and destination location. Functions are provided to automate the calculation of a variety of common accessibility indicators formulations. In general users concentrate on travel time analysis since the data is more readily available. However analysis of travel costs is also common.
