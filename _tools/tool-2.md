The instrument calculates travel time for car and public transport to one or many selected destinations with a 500 m geographical resolution for the entire Västra Götaland region. It is also spatially compatible with a large number of socio-economic data sets, which enables further analysis. The core of the calculation and data manipulation is developed by a consultancy firm3 as a plug-in using the TransCAD software package. For further analysis and visualisation other GIS software is used. Public transport travel time calculations are based on time table OD data.
