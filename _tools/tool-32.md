Spatial Network Analysis of Public Transport Accessibility (SNAPTA) is a GIS - based accessibility instrument that relies on a package of different measures to quantify spatial accessibility to urban services and activity opportunities by public transport modes. The instrument, therefore, takes into account the land use and transport characteristics of urban interactions and the availability of opportunities that can be accessed by public transport. It focuses on groups of people, and their social and economic activity needs to be met at different destinations. It assumes that travel demand will be determined by the attractiveness of these locations and the quality of the transport infrastructure linking these places.
