GOAT stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-instrument is meant to be open source, interactive, flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is under development at the Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at TUM. GOAT is designed to model active mobility (e.g. walking, cycling), enhancements and extensions are done on a regular basis. You can transfer GOAT to your area of study or test the demo version for different study areas (e.g. Munich).
