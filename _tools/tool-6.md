GOATbeta stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-tool is meant to be open source, interactive, flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is under development at the Chair for Urban Structure and Transport Planning at TUM. Currently, GOATbeta is designed to model walking accessibility, however frequent enhancements and extensions will be made on a regular basis. At the moment you can test the demo version of GOATbeta for the city of Munich here.
