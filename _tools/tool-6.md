The instrument measures different types of accessibility. First travel times between municipalities are measured. Also these travel times are compared over years to have an overall view. Accessibility in this case means not only the time needed and distance to a newly developed transport infrastructure. The instrument looks also on accessibility aspects before and after the new transport infrastructure was established in the same municipality. Also it has a stronger look on regions which are no longer connected, because of the new transport infrastructure, traversing another way. The instrument is most useful after implementing a new transport infrastructure, because it is hard to analysis social behaviour before something happened in reality
