The SAL tool is a geographical representation of comparative accessibility levels by types of transport modes to different types of opportunities generating travel. It is based on the concept of accessibility, defined as the extent to which the land use and transport systems enable individuals to reach different types of opportunities. More specifically, SAL proposes the concept of ‘structural accessibility’ for assessing how urban structures constrain travel choices. In other words, it provides foresight on how specific land use and transport policies enable or limit particular choices of the inhabitants.
