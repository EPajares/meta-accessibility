The Joint Accessibility Design framework consists of a methodology that uses accessibility mapping to enhance coherent decision-making between urban and mobility planning. Accessibility maps depict the accessibility of specific locations within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, time of day and target group. The JAD framework provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land-use development, and thus support the exploration of the scope for joint action.
