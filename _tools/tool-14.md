The JAD (Joint-Accessibility Design) provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land-use development, and thus support the exploration of the scope for joint action. The joint-accessibility-design framework has been used in three cases in the Netherlands, they were applied to real planning problems and developed with planning practitioners. The scientific questions were: How to measure accessibility to support integrated transport and land-use strategy making? How to use accessibility measures in integrated transport- and land-use strategy making processes? Does the use of accessibility measures in planning practice lead to more integrated transport- and land-use strategies?
