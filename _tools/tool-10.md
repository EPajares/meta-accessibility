UrbCA is a dynamic model that simulates land use change over a space divided into irregular cells designed from the traditional census blocks. Cells have at each moment a given cell state (or land use) from a finite cell of cell states which change through time taking into account the cell states of a given number of neighboring cells. This evolution is provided by a set of transition rules that parameterize the behaviors of all the drivers at stake. The use of UrbCA in the appraisal of accessibility in planning focuses on the possibility of simulating different planning solutions under different planning parameters taking into account different accessibility conditions, which are a result of the investments on the road network.
