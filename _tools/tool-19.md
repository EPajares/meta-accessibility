This instrument may be applied purposefully in planning as well as in scientific context. Representing ‘actual’ behaviours can supplement and provide a basis for interpretation accessibility and access needs. The main strength of this instrument is that it may be said to represent what people do. On this basis it may gain acceptance and wide application and allow for multiple interpretations.
