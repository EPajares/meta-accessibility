A multi-modal travel accessibility tool that allows editing of network data to produce what-if scenarios and utilises detailed demographic data. Over 500 users worldwide from local to central/federal governments, healthcare and private industry, TRACC has been used to identify key locations for housing, healthcare, transport routes and is used to inform policy. TRACC allows calculations at both local and national level and is commonly used for local government to create accessibility/local plans to inform which areas of a region have poor access and where investment is required.
