This tool is intended for the accessibility-based evaluation of specific transportation
and land-use projects. For land-use projects, a population and employment increase
must be associated with the project along with intersection-specific travel time delays.
Then the change in auto-based accessibility to jobs is calculated. For transportation
projects, land-use and transportation patterns before the project are compared with
land-use and transportation patterns after the project, with a comparison fo the
average per capita job accessibility provided.
