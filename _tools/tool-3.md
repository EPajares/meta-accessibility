The main innovation in MARS is that the different reaction speeds of the two systems (passenger transport system and land use system) are taken into consideration. These different speeds generate a dynamic process which is looking for a dynamic equilibrium, which is disturbed by external transport or land use policy measures, such as road capacity increases, public transport supply changes or land use instruments, such as e.g. a land value capture tax. MARS calculates the accessibility for each zone for each means of transport for each simulation period and uses this information to redistribute the daily trips of population as well as the relocation of workplaces and housing within the case study area for a simulation period of 30 years.
