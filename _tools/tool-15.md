The accessibility instruments GraBAM can be used to measure the distribution of wider economic benefits of alternative transportation projects. Furthermore, by working with data in a GIS environment, the spatial distribution of current accessibility levels as well as future changes in accessibility can be displayed. Accessibility levels and changes can be associated with socioeconomic data available at the zone level to estimate how current accessibility and benefits may vary by socioeconomic group.
