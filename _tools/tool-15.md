The accessibility instrument GraBAM (Gravity-Based Accessibility Measures) can be used to answer the following planning question: ‘Who reaps the benefits from investments in the transport system, and where are these benefits localised?’ It can be applied in a variety of operational planning and public involvement activities of transport agencies. The tool can identify the interrelations between transport infrastructures (changing zonal accessibility) and the spatial distribution of the impacts on socio-economic activities. GraBAM can also assist urban planners in identifying optimal locations for new development areas. Moreover, it can also support the analysis of the real estate market dynamics.
