 Spatiality_lines aims at contributing a way of measuring how a street grid becomes metrically denser or sparser, more or less intelligible and more or less easily accessible. One practical outcome is to support the appropriate design of streets as part of urban developments. It can inform us on how the street network can be designed so as to ensure that some places, intended as retail hubs, business cores or local centres, will be more likely to attract higher densities of movement, whereas others, intended for residential uses, will remain quieter (Hillier, 1993).
