Conveyal is a web-based tool that enables users to create detailed scenarios, then rapidly evaluate them in terms of accessibility. It automatically builds multi-modal networks for metropolitan regions, through uploaded street network (OSM), transit feed (GTFS), and other geospatial data. Conveyalâ€™s innovative methods provide unique insights into temporal variation. For example, users can edit transit frequency levels with the built-in scenario editor, then compare impacts at different percentiles of travel time. Running in the cloud, Conveyal scales to provide results in seconds, even for billions of origin-destination pairs. Transport departments and planning authorities have used Conveyal to evaluate city, state, and national scenarios in more than 30 countries around the world.
