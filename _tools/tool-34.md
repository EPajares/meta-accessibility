accessibility offers a set of fast and convenient functions to calculate multiple transport accessibility measures. Given a pre-computed travel cost matrix and a land use dataset (containing the location of jobs, healthcare and population, for example), the package allows one to calculate active and passive accessibility levels using multiple accessibility measures, such as: cumulative opportunities (using either travel cost cutoffs or intervals), minimum travel cost to closest N number of activities, gravity-based (with different decay functions) and different floating catchment area methods.
