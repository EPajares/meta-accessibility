The instrument developed by SiTI, called InViTo (acronym of Interactive Visualization Tool), aims to provide a visual interactive support to large scale planning processes. The tool is intended to provide an effective basis for sharing information and enabling discussion among different actors such as planners, stakeholders and, in general, non-expert people within focus groups, workshops, participative and collaborative processes. The main strength of InViTo is represented by the possibility of managing interactive and dynamic scenarios, in order to visualize in real time the effects of decision making on urban form and to support the planning processes.
